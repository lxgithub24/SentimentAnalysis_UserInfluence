Plenty end up there that already trained youLHM#d of just had a couple of weeks then for the dog to bond with you and get used to be surroundings. Puppies are like toddlers it sounds like you donLHM#t want the responsibility which is a shame a dog is a loyal pal for the next 15 yrs sometimes longer thatLHM#s another consideration that if your off to college or work all day out with friends at night or not willing to find somewhere that allows pets if you move, starting a family and the dog would be too much with a new baby I see these excuses multiple times daily on free ads itLHM#s pitiful. Dogs have feelings you ever see one been turfed out the car abandoned and it will stay there days waiting for the *** who dumped it to come back.

Of course a dog chews stuff , WHY leave stuff around that you DONLHM#T want him to chew. Get a plastic spray bottle , fill it with water & every time he tries to go wires spray him with water. Get him TOYS he CAN chew on, that WONLHM#T hurt him . START TRAINING HIM ,take him to training classes, The dog has only been in your home for 1 week so it IS all NEW to HIM . **** ! just WHY the hell did your family get a dog if NONE of you are willing to TRAIN it OR care for it properly , my heart goes out to the POOR dog living with such STUPID folk in an home where all they do IS shout , yell & whine .	2	· 3 weeks ago ·	/activity/questions?show=NWP7AP3D5234M2KP22N2Z3UBKA&t=g	Pets Dogs	3	0	Comment	2016-05-02T01:48:26Z

If you want you can get a shock collar that shocks him when he barks (donLHM#t over use it). What kind of dog is he? Do you exercise him? Does he have a bed? How old is he?

Plenty end up there that already trained youLHM#d of just had a couple of weeks then for the dog to bond with you and get used to be surroundings. Puppies are like toddlers it sounds like you donLHM#t want the responsibility which is a shame a dog is a loyal pal for the next 15 yrs sometimes longer thatLHM#s another consideration that if your off to college or work all day out with friends at night or not willing to find somewhere that allows pets if you move, starting a family and the dog would be too much with a new baby I see these excuses multiple times daily on free ads itLHM#s pitiful. Dogs have feelings you ever see one been turfed out the car abandoned and it will stay there days waiting for the *** who dumped it to come back. They feel fear sadness depression happiness grief just like us. If itLHM#s just a dog to you and training is a hassle please find it a good home	1	· 3 weeks ago ·	/activity/questions?show=BZC2PYPAGHRZEWK6SSOPYPRS3A&t=g	Pets Dogs	1	0	Comment	2016-05-02T01:48:26Z

Of course a dog chews stuff , WHY leave stuff around that you DONLHM#T want him to chew. Get a plastic spray bottle , fill it with water & every time he tries to go wires spray him with water. Get him TOYS he CAN chew on, that WONLHM#T hurt him . START TRAINING HIM ,take him to training classes, The dog has only been in your home for 1 week so it IS all NEW to HIM . **** ! just WHY the hell did your family get a dog if NONE of you are willing to TRAIN it OR care for it properly , my heart goes out to the POOR dog living with such STUPID folk in an home where all they do IS shout , yell & whine .	2	· 3 weeks ago ·	/activity/questions?show=NWP7AP3D5234M2KP22N2Z3UBKA&t=g	Pets Dogs	3	0	Comment	2016-05-02T01:48:26Z

If you want you can get a shock collar that shocks him when he barks (donLHM#t over use it). What kind of dog is he? Do you exercise him? Does he have a bed? How old is he?

You need a hand held snake that is at least 15 foot long. It is wrapped on a coil with a turning lever. One can be had for no more than 30usd.

I tried plunging it, and pouring hot water down it, and that didnLHM#t help. I tried pouring hot... Thanks to all who replied- It was just a stubborn clog. The toilet is fixed. Crisis averted.	try an auger	7	· 5 months ago ·	/activity/questions?show=B3MIF33AKQB4V764IGRPYZ6SFA&t=g	Home & Garden Do It Yourself (DIY)	0	0	Comment	2016-01-08T14:54:53Z
20100306220518AAR4cyX	Is it bad for a guy to be shorter than his grilfriend?	or his date,or maybe both .	No, itLHM#s not bad. But why would it? I donLHM#t see how it would matter if the guy was shorter or vice versa. As long as you get along great, height shouldnLHM#t really matter.	0	· 6 years ago	/activity/questions?show=EJLBPPPHFVKLWT4NZWUB4K4HNA&t=g	Family & Relationships Singles & Dating	0	0	Comment	2010-03-07T06:05:18Z
20100306220518AAR4cyX	Is it bad for a guy to be shorter than his grilfriend?	or his date,or maybe both .	What could be bad? There are many qualities to consider, and I donLHM#t believe it should matter whoLHM#s the shortest. You donLHM#t always have to physically look up to a person to like, respect or love him or her. I have seen couples who some would say are mismatched simply because the guy is shorter. But you know what? Many such couples stay married or together longer than some of the rest of us. So why not give it a chance.	1	· 6 years ago ·	/activity/questions?show=5NGZ3FZOWSQZO5NNWCNF7EX5EM&t=g	Family & Relationships Singles & Dating	0	0	Comment	2010-03-07T06:05:18Z
20100306220518AAR4cyX	Is it bad for a guy to be shorter than his grilfriend?	or his date,or maybe both .	You cannot help who you are attracted to if he treats you good and makes you feel special, his height should not be an issue. Now a days there are all kinds of mismatched couples that are perfect for each other. Besides, I have learned that opposites attract. So put some flats on and go have a good time because that is what dating is all about!	2	· 6 years ago ·	/activity/questions?show=AUBPCTFT4H5BH3UVXZZHYBJEJA&t=g	Family & Relationships Singles & Dating	0	0	Comment	2010-03-07T06:05:18Z

ItLHM#s only "societal demand" but it means nothing. I had a long-term relationship with a guy 2 inches shorter than me. Further proof? Look at Hollywood. Many models & actresses are taller than their husbands/boyfriends. To top it off, they wear heels.

(I live in the LA area, in California)	Omggg I need one too.	2	· 3 months ago ·	/activity/questions?show=ITPCY43CXFYBYR2JIJZYC5A6SA&t=g	Business & Finance Personal Finance	1	0	1 comment	2016-03-10T02:38:12Z	/activity/questions?show=ZUAVGY7ZV3KXZVBNJO3ANFWFEI&t=g
20160113121859AAUPgjE	My mom takes away my laptop every single school night ever since 9th grade started.. I need my laptop for exams but she wonLHM#t listen?	So basically every night my parents take away all of my electronics.When I was in eighth grade my parents let me use electronics, but since I started high school they thought because ILHM#m in a new school and itLHM#s harder than 8th grade that they should take it away. It frustrates me so much. I get good grades...	I completely understand! Your parents donLHM#t trust you. Try to talk to them about why you need your laptop. Offer them compromises like they can monitor your use if they are worried. Or say that if they are worried about your sleep they can come I at 10 and take it away. But they need to understand that you need to type papers and if you want to get good grades you must stay up late studying. There is no successful person in this world that has had a good nights sleep while in school!	0	· 4 months ago	/activity/questions?show=XLQ5ZHMQAVWKCHAKNL33YQKH7M&t=g	Family & Relationships Family	2	1	Comment	2016-01-13T20:18:59Z	/activity/questions?show=7TF2BEVSBXWZR62O7ZIEMO7NCI&t=g

End it now or an extremely bad argument will come up and youLHM#ll never speak again. Find other friends, and tell her straight out you canLHM#t be her friend anymore.( provide and explanation too, hopefully she can grow from it and become a better person) and find better friends.

But sheLHM#s my best friend and i still care about her because ILHM#m dumb af	First of all she is not your best friend. A best friend doesnLHM#t lie and gossip with other people about you. You need to cut ties with her, block her, hang out with other people, avoid her and be honest with other people and tell them what she has done. She is not loyal to you at all so you owe her absolutely nothing. You are not dumb you have just been a good, nice person and she has taken advantage of that. DonLHM#t allow it anymore. The more you are seen hanging around with her the more people will believe rumours and bad things that they have been told because they see you with her. If you are apart people might question it and realise there is a problem which then will help them understand that what they were told about you is not true. You donLHM#t need to argue with her just distance yourself from her. Show her that she canLHM#t take advantage of you and that you deserve respect. DonLHM#t refer to her as your best friend...she isnLHM#t a true friend and cut her out as soon as you can.	1	· 3 months ago ·	/activity/questions?show=DQ2DELGGERLX7RMEKDLIT2PAZE&t=g	Family & Relationships Friends	1	0	Comment	2016-03-08T00:12:31Z	/activity/questions?show=JS6M2QGS7PF2ARHNPRYMJQD6CI&t=g

There are usually internal stitches as well as external ones, and although there should be no problems with either, especially this long after the surgery, sometimes the unexpected can happen. If this is to do with the surgery, you should only be charged for a repeat consultation and any further treatment needed. DonLHM#t leave this - it may be nothing, but itLHM#s always best to check.	1	· 2 days ago ·	/activity/questions?show=H7QE4752KX2GXF6DUEWQKMI5CU&t=g	Pets Dogs	1	0	Comment	2016-05-24T08:40:48Z	/activity/questions?show=J3FR3TQU2AQWA4WL7ZRNKEJG5Y&t=g

The first "that" and its relative clause describes the cat. The second "that" and its relative clause describes the milk by defining what I did with the milk. But that is two relative clauses, one inside another one.

20150831050726AAgoz3p	This world will end?	null	Many Internet websites say the world will end in December 2012. Answer (A):The world will not end in 2012. Our planet has been getting along just fine for more than 4 billion years, and credible scientists worldwide know of no threat associated with 2012.The destruction of a solar system has been captured for the first time by astronomers who said the violent events provide a grim glimpse of Earth’s ultimate fate. Images taken by NASA’s Kepler 2 space mission reveal the rocky remains of a world that is being torn apart as it spirals around a dead star, or white dwarf, in the constellation of Virgo, 570 light years from Earth. Scientists spotted chunks of shredded planet swinging around the white dwarf every 4.5 to five hours, placing them in an orbit about 520,000 miles from the star, about twice the distance between the Earth and the moon.Earth will ultimately be vaporized by a dead Sun. Mercifully, we wonLHM#t be around to experience it.An artist’s interpretation of the events, captured by Kepler 2, showing a Ceres-like asteroid slowly disintegrating as it orbits a white dwarf star. (Photograph: Mark A. Garlick/CfA via NASA) “This is something no human has seen before,” said Andrew Vanderburg at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. “We’re watching a solar system get destroyed.” Sun-like stars are driven by nuclear reactions that transform hydrogen into helium. But when the hydrogen runs out, they burn heavier elements, such as helium, carbon and oxygen, and expand dramatically. Eventually, the star sheds its outer layers to leave an Earth-sized core known as a white dwarf. Vanderburg’s team spotted the cosmic catastrophe with the Kepler 2 mission, which can detect the existence of new planets by the telltale dimming they cause when they pass in front of their parent stars. Instead of looking at sun-like stars, the scientists studied a white dwarf known in astronomical circles as WD1145+017. They found that every 4.5 hours, Kepler 2 detected a 40 percent drop in light from the star, as a chunk of material moved across its face. Initial observations from Kepler were backed up with further measurements from other telescopes, including the Whipple Observatory in Massachusetts, the MEarth-South telescope in Chile and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Together, they found evidence for several lumps of rock in orbit around the dead star.ArtistLHM#s impression of of the Kepler space telescope. (credit: NASA Ames/W Stenzel) Writing in the journal, Nature, Vanderburg describes the results as the first evidence for rocky, disintegrating bodies around a white dwarf. The discovery explains a long-standing, if obscure, mystery in astronomy: the source of the heavy metal pollution seen in some white dwarf stars. by DNSUnlockerX “We now have a smoking gun linking white dwarf pollution to the destruction of rocky planets,” Vanderburg said. Astronomers are not clear where the rocky objects came from in the first place, but one possibility is that the star’s death destabilised the orbit of a neighboring massive planet in such a way that smaller rocky worlds were kicked towards the star. They get so close that the searing heat starts to vaporise them as the gravitational forces tear them apart. A similar fate may well await our own solar system. When the sun dies in five billion years, it will expand and engulf the inner planets, toasting Mercury and Venus, and potentially Earth too. But if Earth survives that cosmic trauma, it may find itself being shredded as it spirals into the white dwarf that the sun becomes. “We might be seeing how our own solar system could be disassembled in the future,” said Vanderburg. Francesca Faedi, an astronomer at the University of Warwick, said the death of the star Vanderburg’s team observed may have sent planets in the distant solar system crashing into one another, reducing them to rocks that resemble asteroids.	0	· 3 months ago	/activity/questions?show=UPPR7OZBNXZH4LEZV6XMVCHJVI&t=g	Family & Relationships Singles & Dating	2	0	Comment	2015-08-31T12:07:26Z	/activity/questions?show=36DB4VEAWWXOWRSWWFHKCJRCNA&t=g

Your voice doesnLHM#t need a lot of work. Of course, youLHM#re only fifteen, and for that age you are very, very good. I agree that you need to work with a vocal coach anyway and practice diction all those things Thithel suggested. Your acting does need improvement; to be on Broadway you need to be more than a good singer. You need to be a top-notch actor, too. Dancing is just as important as those two. Take lessons in all three, become a triple-threat (someone who does all three professionally), and knock everyone out of the water when you audition! I suggest that you educate yourself about all things Broadway. Look up Equity. Broadway takes a lot of work. Believe in yourself, put in the work, and you will make it. I can totally see you on Broadway. Good luck, darling!	0	· 2 years ago	/activity/questions?show=G5AN7UY5236MAJK6EO3LRI2H3A&t=g	Arts & Humanities Theater & Acting	0	0	1 comment	2014-06-02T01:48:10Z	/activity/questions?show=SU6R6PNXPUKOAKMIXW36ASTCOM&t=g

To be on Broadway is going to take a lot. Heres what I would suggest: You have a very good voice, what you dhould be working on are things like projection, diction, and all of the basic techniques that vocalists need. If you listen to broadway singers youll notice they all have almost perfect technique. Other than that, study privately with a vocal instructor and your voice will continue to progress. The other thing I noticed was your acting. Acting is every bit as important as singing in musical theater. In your video, your feet shuffle slightly as you sing and you could be using more of the stage. Its all about stage presence. Again, try to find coaches and instructors to help! You are incredibly talented, I think if you keep working hard you can reach your goal.	1	· 2 years ago ·	/activity/questions?show=IVUUZXIGJKYNAZJR3HVJFHEIY4&t=g	Arts & Humanities Theater & Acting	0	0	Comment	2014-06-02T01:48:10Z	/activity/questions?show=SU6R6PNXPUKOAKMIXW36ASTCOM&t=g

Just make sure whatever you get is meaningful and you like it. If your considering that this tattoo might be too LHM#gayLHM# or LHM#stupidLHM# then you dont sound very confident in it, so i must ask, why get it? Dont just get a tattoo to get a tattoo. Even though its a date with some significance does that really make it worthy of a tattoo. If you want to show appreciation for your mom why not build her something? If you want something for yourself to remember her by why not craft a ring or necklace that has her name, image or birthdate on it? Why a tattoo? Are you into art? if so then great maybe a tattoo is a good decision.. Idk.

20160526033255AAOB4SR	How many civilians died in the civil war?

In the first two years of the war there was a lot of sympathy for the other side, partly because so many people had relatives among the enemy or because a majority of soldiers felt that the enemy were erring brothers who just needed to be confronted with the right amount of force. After Gettysburg the attitudes hardened a great deal. The most barbarous fighting took place in Missouri between partisan guerillas and Union troops. Southerners have always believed that the collapse of the prison in Leavenworth that took the lives of several dozen Southern prisoners was deliberate, but there is no reason to believe this. In retaliation Quantrille led a raid into Leavenworth that resulted in many deaths, but under 300. That was the worst atrocity of the war. But Quantrille forbade rape, and if you read the letters of women at the time, there is almost no mention of rape on either side. If there had been, the newspapers would have screamed about it, but they did not. Gen. Sherman ordered the evacuation of cities and towns before he torched them, which was a crime, but itLHM#s not on the same level as wholesale slaughter. He also punished looters. Shelby Foote is a very reliable historian.	0	· 20 hours ago	/activity/questions?show=RUVBRVGIAH4ALMVAW52WLDLDJY&t=g	Arts & Humanities History	1	0	1 comment	2016-05-26T10:32:55Z	/activity/questions?show=NO3B5TTUMNTHAIYBJCNEOROWNM&t=g

20160311175556AAEEVAG	Why is the Holocaust all about the Jews?	Hitler did NOT believe in the master race or evolutionary superiority; all of DarwinLHM#s books (and his theory of evolution) were banned in Nazi Germany, and Atheists put in the concentration camps as "undesirables" = FACT! Atheism was banned in Nazi Germany = FACT! People were required by law to believe in God. = FACT! Hitler said atheists have no morals = FACT! The Bible says tat God hates certain races = FACT!	ItLHM#s not all about Jews. Jews are the focal point because they comprised most of the victims. Jews were the biggest victim not because the Nazis hated them the most, but because they were easy victims. Had Germany taken Russia, hundreds of millions would have died like the Jews. The Jews were easy victims, because they had no country, no army and no country willing to take them in. A 1938 Harvard Crimson article found that >70% of Harvard students were against giving Jews asylum. Most of the rich intellectuals throughout the world supported the Nazi perspective. The main opposition to it came from poor Christians. America had great relations with Nazi Germany until the late 30LHM#s, and actually advised them on how to pass the Nuremberg laws based on our experience enacting Jim Crow laws. All of the anti-Semitic laws in Germany were 100% modeled after Jim Crow. If you donLHM#t believe me, please research this topic on google using only reputable sources (eg: academic articles or wikipedia). If Israel existed then, thereLHM#s no Holocaust. Germany either would have sent them there or more likely wouldnLHM#t have persecuted Jews as much as they did, because they would not have risked going to war with Israel. Contrary to how Nazism is taught in our schools, these people were not waking up saying, "Kill Jews!" If they thought for one second it would lower their chances of winning against Russia or England, the Holocaust never happens. The Holocaust was also not specific to Jews. The gypsies, homosexuals, etc. and families of criminals were also victims. The idea was all in genetics so if you stole an apple, itLHM#s not that you did bad but that youLHM#re a bad seed and your family is therefore a bad seed. There were some characteristics of Jews that Hitler even admired. If you put all those Jews in America, and put all the blacks in America in Germany, we have the same outcome and you complain the Holocaust is all about blacks. Lastly, itLHM#s debatable how much of the Holocaust was stuff the Nazis themselves believed in, and how much of it was made up to let the Nazis appeal to the anti-Semitic left who opposed NazismLHM#s social and and economic policies, and the fact that the Holocaust allowed the government to essentially tax a wealthy minority at 100% rate. All the money the victims left behind wasnLHM#t distributed to the German people. It was all taken by the government. The Rothsteins and several prominent German Jews got out of Nazi Germany, not by escaping but by the Nazis helping them. Why? Because Adolph Eichmann (the man who masterminded the whole Holocaust) approached the wealthiest Jews, and told them they didnLHM#t have to die - he negotiated a deal whereby 1000 Jews were put on a train and led to safety in exchange for the modern day equivalent of $100MM. I ask you: would ISIS take such a deal? Al Quada? This was the man who hated Jews more than anyone else proposing this deal. To make matters even funnier, the rule ended up being you were a Jew if you had one grandparent who was a Jew. Originally, it was great grandparents, but it turned out that several big Nazis had more distant relatives who were Jews. The law kept on changing to make sure no key Nazi figures would be impacted. This by itself should make it apparent that the Nazis likely didnLHM#t even hate Jews as much as the Holocaust makes it seem. The Nazis never even cracked 40% of the vote. If getting the votes of the insane 5% brought them from 25 to 28% the Nazis were very willing to simply throw in some crazy policies. My honest belief is that Hitler didnLHM#t buy the master race thing. It was a scam to get money and power. If the country were 30% Jewish, I have no doubt HitlerLHM#s politics would have been about Jews being equal, loving Jews, etc. He was a sociopath - only cared about Hitler. On genetics: 1.) During the 1920LHM#s, eugenics was the most popular debate in the ENTIRE WORLD, not just Germany. The debate was whether itLHM#s good/bad to kill individuals who harm the gene pool. Most people were pro-Eugenics outside of the Christian right who was against it, because of the belief all life is sacred. 2.) The reason it was a load of bull is because there is a lot of subjectivity. In American eugenics, Anglo-Saxans were the master race. In Germany, Aryans were. You see where this is going. 3.) Darwin was simply evolution. Science moved way past him. Books like Hans GunthersLHM# Race and Soul were REQUIRED READING IN ALL GERMAN SCHOOLS. GunthersLHM# book argues that not only do people with better genes turn out physically better, they also have better souls. 4.) Hitler didnLHM#t like Christianity. In 1941, millions of German Christians protested Action T4. What happened was if you had a child with downs syndrome, for instance, the state took them to take care of them under law. 6 months later youLHM#d get ashes and get a letter about how your kid didnLHM#t make it. The problem was due to a clerical error, one family got a second set of remains with the same letter, and the country was pissed. Hitler couldnLHM#t kill every Christian so he admitted what happened, and said he was sorry. If you donLHM#t believe me, google it. It was in the New York Times, every international paper. 5.) Hitler tried to make the Nazis appeal to Christians through symbolism, not because he liked Christians, but because there was no way for any politician to dump on Christians, and win Germany. Hitler didnLHM#t like atheism either, because atheists donLHM#t believe in anything. By HitlerLHM#s words, Islam was the perfect religion for any country wishing to take over the world. But Hitler was NOT Muslim. If you research HitlerLHM#s life he was not a religious man. To him, religion was tool and he favored religions that could be manipulated into supporting him. I think Hitler liked Islam, because if all Germans were Muslim, Hitler could convince them heLHM#s restoring the caliphate and have a billion people willing to die for him to get into power. He simply wanted religions that could be manipulated into following his agenda. Judaism is inherently poorly suited for this, because they donLHM#t worship any one man and will never abandon their book to follow the advice of one man. ItLHM#s simply impossible for any one person to accumulate too much power in a Jewish world, because Judaism is less built on individual heroism than other faiths. In addition our moral system today is based on Judeo-Christian fusion of thought that makes Nazism hard to understand. The fundamental difference between the two is this: if a strong kid beats up a weak kid, we shame the strong kid worse than if the positions were reversed and the weak kid beat the strong kid. The eugenics idea was we should praise the strong kid, because by encouraging strength we build a stronger and healthier world. This idea seems crazy now, but it was not back then. One can even argue the Holocaust benefited the entire world, because once it came to light, the eugenics movement immediately lost all credibility. Had it not happened, the world would be different today.	0	· 3 months ago	/activity/questions?show=O5EUHG4ZBLUADA5RFDQPJ4VPHE&t=g	Politics & Government Politics	2	0	Comment	2016-03-12T01:55:56Z	/activity/questions?show=XUG3S2QMHKIKPGNCNPJEAQEBTU&t=g

Discussion of the Holocaust usually features the Nazi attempt to exterminate Jews because they, more than any other group, were the target of it. Gypsies, homosexuals, trades unionists and other groups were also persecuted, but the effort were principally directed at Jews (or rather, at those the Nazis classified as Jews). Million were murdered. Your history is pretty weak: the Nazis were not particularly interested in Christianity, some Nazis held neo-pagan views and the party even organized a campaign to encourage apostasy from the christian faith, although the campaign was a complete failure. Several clergymen, both Catholic and Protestant were murdered for their opposition to Nazi policies.	1	· 3 months ago ·	/activity/questions?show=W6LPQBDZBPXBUY5BOYLISVNGVA&t=g	Politics & Government Politics	0	0	1 comment	2016-03-12T01:55:56Z	/activity/questions?show=XUG3S2QMHKIKPGNCNPJEAQEBTU&t=g

20160524021652AAD6SZt	Would it be less expensive to just Dump all the trash on planet earth into space?	Instead of the land or ocean, hiring all garbage people, trucks, machines maybe just a giant hollow Rocket filled with garbage and send it to space since the Universe is so Gigantic.	Nope. The LEAST expensive method and best for the economy and the environment is impractical because that would involve individuals only buying stuff they need rather than throwing between 1/5th an d1/3rd of everything they buy from a supermarket in the bin. It would also involve everyone sorting their trash between recyclable and non-recyclable and reusing anything that can be re-used. Failing that, incinerating waste in a waste to energy reclamation plant and is better than just incinerating waste and the energy being lost. Dumping in a land fill is pretty cheap but very bad for the environment and in the long term will cost a lot more but short term thinkers never consider the long term implications and since short term thinkers tend to be most successful we are lumbered with the consequences of their poor judgement. Blasting waste into space is by far the most expensive option and worst for the environment because of the huge cost of rocket fuel.	0	· 3 days ago	/activity/questions?show=ZVQTBYHJC4TG2IM3KBVFKVOPOE&t=g	Science & Mathematics Astronomy & Space	1	0	Comment	2016-05-24T09:16:52Z	/activity/questions?show=SMJVMCENZSKUWBBK7SJ2TFCPVM&t=g

20160521205005AAvrC3n	Why can some people write a 100 page script in a few days but it takes me a week to write one page?	And then I give up on it because I either get tired of it or think it is bad. I donLHM#t get how itLHM#s so hard for me. Ed Wood used to write full length screenplay in days. Am I just too young to try (I am under 20 years old)? I know the structure and art of screenwriting, just to clear things up. I have been trying for almost a year now, following every piece of advice I got. Nothing seems to help	Without wishing to sound negative, that is the difference from a professional and someone just writing for fun. Your writing doesnLHM#t entertain you or hold your interest, so itLHM#s unlikely anyone else will feel good about it also. Only write when you really feel you have something to write about, and maybe one day youLHM#ll end up with something that you feel so passionately about, you wonLHM#t be able to stop yourself from writing even if it feels bad at first, because you can fix it in the rewrites. But youLHM#ll have the passion to get to the end of your story, leave it alone for a bit, then go back and rewrite to make it as strong as possible. Example: I wrote a comedy script which I thought was good but didnLHM#t know what to do with it. I forgot about it for a bit. 10 years later, I was writing a commissioned comedy show and had learned so much more about getting work sold. After, I dug out that old script and realised it needed some real working on. I tightened it up, cut it to the bone, moved some bits around, added lots of new material. I was so excited afterwards because it now felt right, and I immediately wrote another two episodes because I had now got the format and rhythm right. I was energised. But it all started with having the material in the first place, and time away to make it work. All the best.	0	· 5 days ago	/activity/questions?show=SYCCD2VWA7BOS64QKZG6J7BOYM&t=g	Arts & Humanities Theater & Acting	2	0	Comment	2016-05-22T03:50:05Z	null

Nothing seems to help	YouLHM#re missing a detail or a few: 100 pages in a few days = FIRST draft following an outline. This is common, what youLHM#re describing. There are a few details you didnLHM#t provide about your writing process, though: Do you outline first? How many drafts do you write? At what stage do you give up? Ever finished a first draft? In general, people stop writing a script or keep starting over because they donLHM#t push past the first draft. They lose their passion for the concept because the first impression is gone and the script (the written words) doesnLHM#t convey their vision. ThereLHM#s a delusion there. ThatLHM#s the first draft syndrome. Experience helps, and you still got years of learning the craft ahead of you, but I donLHM#t think age has anything to do with this particular problem. It happens to everybody. What you need to do, aside from outline before you start writing and rewrite a number of times, is power through - even if itLHM#s bad. It is bad, itLHM#s a first draft. DonLHM#t think about it. Accept it, knowing you will rewrite later. If that doesnLHM#t help, be harder on yourself: adopt a routine of writing every single day (choose your time and place) and think of it as a job. Set a deadline (maybe of a contest) to give yourself motivation. Be clear with yourself that you HAVE to finish FIRST draft. It takes self-discipline - thatLHM#s part of the problem. If youLHM#ve been writing for (less than) a year, chances are you donLHM#t have that self-discipline yet. If youLHM#re not writing every day, get on it. -That will help you along the way.	1	· 5 days ago ·	/activity/questions?show=TBVNUY56PE32F5A6PJRZHKXHHQ&t=g	Arts & Humanities Theater & Acting	4	0	Comment	2016-05-22T03:50:05Z	null

20160519004632AANsEKv	What is the purpose of mark’s Gospel and the intended audience.?	null	In Mark the disciples, and especially the Twelve, move from lack of perception of Jesus to rejection of the "way of suffering" to flight and denial – even the women who received the first proclamation of his resurrection can be seen as failures for not reporting the good news. There is much discussion of this theme among scholars. Some argue that the author of Mark was using the disciples to correct "erroneous" views in his own community concerning the reality of the suffering messiah, others that it is an attack on the Jerusalem branch of the church for resisting the extension of the gospel to the gentiles, or a mirror of the convertLHM#s usual experience of the initial enthusiasm followed by growing awareness of the necessity for suffering. It certainly reflects the strong theme in Mark of Jesus as the "suffering just one" portrayed in so many of the books of the Jewish scriptures, from Jeremiah to Job and the Psalms, but especially in the "Suffering Servant" passages Isaiah. It also reflects the Jewish scripture theme of GodLHM#s love being met by infidelity and failure, only to be renewed by God. And in the real-world context in which the gospel was written, the persecutions of the Christians of Rome under Nero, the failure of the disciples and JesusLHM# denial by Peter himself would have been powerful symbols of faith, hope and reconciliation.	0	· 1 week ago	/activity/questions?show=SYCCD2VWA7BOS64QKZG6J7BOYM&t=g	Society & Culture Religion & Spirituality	1	1	Comment	2016-05-19T07:46:32Z	null
20160519004632AANsEKv	What is the purpose of mark’s Gospel and the intended audience.?	null	The gospel of Mark appears to be the first of the four gospels to be written. Matthew and Luke each repeated about 90% of MarkLHM#s gospel in their writings each adding additional details to the accounts of Mark. Matthew and Luke each share about 5% of their material that is not found in Mark, and each has between 10% and 15% of unique material (the largest section being LukeLHM#s details on the conception and birth of Jesus and John the Baptist.) If you read the book of Acts, on his first missionary journey Paul took Mark along to be a "first hand witness" to the events of the life of Jesus. Mark had been one of his followers (though not one of the 12 inner circle of disciples) and had even been present at the Last Supper and the arrest of Jesus. As Paul had not known Jesus personally, he felt the need to have someone there who had. Mark would later put his account of Jesus on paper. It is already being quoted in other sources (such as PaulLHM#s first letter to the Corinthians) as early as 55 AD. Within 25 years of the life of Jesus. Paul presents those quotes as if they are "common knowledge" and felt no need to cite his source, as everyone would have been familiar with this writing. Imply that the text had been around for several years before that. The intended audience was new converts needs to know about th teachings and life and Jesus, and anyone interested in learning about Jesus. The gospel is written in Koine Greek (the mos common language in that region at that time) and has a style that is modeled after Greek and Roman literature. It appears to be aimed more towards a Gentile audience then a Jewish audience. (Matthew is the gospel most aimed at a Jewish audience.)	1	· 1 week ago ·	/activity/questions?show=7OXA4FI3ILOFB25FUG3JLKWF2Y&t=g	Society & Culture Religion & Spirituality	1	1	Comment	2016-05-19T07:46:32Z	null

20151118223540AAsbNGi	Did Romeo and Juliet express true love with each other?	They just met, guys. They just met. Is it possible that when you meet someone for the first time you already love them? Then a day or two you instantly get married even though both of you are only 13 and 16? In the ending, Romeo finds JulietLHM#s "dead" body and drinks poison (because he cannot face... Was it true love ; puppy love ; strong admiration etc... And when you kill yourself because the person you LHM#loveLHM# just died, is it considered as true love already? Ex: YouLHM#re wife/girlfriend/mom just died, will you kill yourself just like what Romeo did to Juliet just to say your love for them is...	The question is what is love? When youLHM#re young and you fall in love for the first time, usually based on lust to begin with, but then most relationships are after all, then it feels overwhelmingly powerful. Contrary to pop songs, love doesnLHM#t actually have to last forever. The fact that they die for each other is a testament of the over-riding power of their feelings, and we call powerful positive feelings love. Such emotions are caused when chemicals in the brain over-ride even good sense. ThatLHM#s why romantic poetry and plays and songs really chime with us - itLHM#s expressing a feeling a bit like being drunk, where all you want is more, even if it destroys you, because right now, itLHM#s making you deliriously happy. There is a modern comedy sequel to R&J where they lived and got married and went off together but actually by middle age they were bored of one another - their families had left them and so they only had each other and they were getting on each othersLHM# nerves a bit. But that happens to all of us, you especially notice it in retirement where a couple now spend much more time with each other and after a while they start annoying one another. However, they still love each other and donLHM#t want to be with anyone else, and what binds them now is their history not lust. I have an Indian friend and she ran off with a guy from a different religion. Both sets of parents immediately disowned them. They havenLHM#t heard from them in 25 years. The couple have children, have had some very rough times, had some very good times, and had all those times when being together was about work, and washing up, and paying bills, etc. If they felt how they do now about each other, maybe they wouldnLHM#t have just run away in a mad youthful blaze of love, but the bond they have now we still call love. Their story is not so different from R&J.	0	· 6 months ago	/activity/questions?show=SYCCD2VWA7BOS64QKZG6J7BOYM&t=g	Arts & Humanities Theater & Acting	1	0	Comment	2015-11-19T06:35:40Z	null

In plays and films the story sometimes has to be hurried along a bit, otherwise the audience might get bored! Shakespeare wrote the typical "boy meets girl" story, but hurried it along. What is not "typical" is that the boy and girl belonged to two families which were sworn enemies. He had to make the "love" seem strong to overcome the oppositions which the two of them came into contact with.	1	· 5 months ago ·	/activity/questions?show=RGXXT2FPG63AG2BFJLWDHQAGGA&t=g	Arts & Humanities Theater & Acting	0	0	Comment	2015-11-19T06:35:40Z	null

20160429212706AArfUxE	Difference between acting and exaggeration?	I have a lot of dramatic scenes in my newest school production. How do I give the full intensity of the emotion without exaggerating?	The best acting doesnLHM#t look like acting at all. For example, if you feel passionately about something (i.e. want to genuinely kill or torture someone, or genuinely love someone) it is always stronger when you donLHM#t move, and donLHM#t shout. Try it, look yourself in the mirror and try the lines "I love you" and "ILHM#m going to make you feel like you want to die" shouting and then again completely still, staring into your eyes, speaking quietly. Only if a part is written to be completely over the top is it worth exaggerating (like a panto dame), but then thatLHM#s usually to keep children interested. But Hannibal Lecter is dangerous because heLHM#s calm, quiet, still, and smiling. Actually heLHM#s a psychopath - a whirlwind of rage. These are extremes, but think about them in relation to your part. People in real life donLHM#t move around that much - they donLHM#t make hand gestures all of the time, they donLHM#t shout or jump or get hyper (unless theyLHM#re ill). Let the words do the talking and use your body and voice sparingly for emphasis - that should be pretty rare. All the best - if I can help further, PM me.	0	· 4 weeks ago	/activity/questions?show=SYCCD2VWA7BOS64QKZG6J7BOYM&t=g	Arts & Humanities Theater & Acting	4	0	Comment	2016-04-30T04:27:06Z	null

Play the truth. Think about how you would react in a situation, or someone you know similar to the character you are playing. Make it real and it will be believable rather than over the top.	3	· 4 weeks ago ·	/activity/questions?show=6LAHRXF6G3TOLR54EU5I4X52DA&t=g	Arts & Humanities Theater & Acting	2	0	Comment	2016-04-30T04:27:06Z	null

Three big earthquakes will shake the three superpowers; 1st big earthquake in Russia; 2nd (bigger one) in China; 3rd (biggest of the three) will be in America. NATO will nuke Ukraine to blame Russia for it; then NATO will nuke Russia from Scandinavia. China will attack Russia; but will not get past Ural Mountains; bio-genetic weapon will be used against Chinese soldiers (they will run back to China and hide in closets in fear) and weather weapon will freeze Siberia to - 200 Celcius; stadium-size chunks of unmeltable ice will fall from the lower sky (because when rockets go into higher sky they bring this ice down to lower sky). Russia will destroy Turkey and America. China will have a hole across the whole country to the abyss (because of another super weapon used to stop Chinese aggression); radiation from this hole will be massive; Chinese will try to keep quiet about it; a lot of people will fall into this hole. Scientists donLHM#t see dinosaurs because of radiation. Only Eurasia and Alaska (both without coasts) will remain after demons blow up Antarctica (which surrounds the flat earth) and Greenland melts. Move to Ural Mountains or inland Alaska. Sionists want war between Russia and Germany over Serbia from June to October on their holidays because (666 times 3)+(6 times 3) = 2016 (in their twisted logic). Tube people = demons. Clones = demons. Human costumes that demons wear = demons. Dinosaurs and 666ed people have triple stranded DNA; normal person canLHM#t swallow 666ed food (designed for 666ed people). Demons live inside clones. Bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin (who discovered Bubonic plague) is depicted on the Shroud of Turin. There is another shroud on which blasphemer Yosef (who was crucified on a pole in 1066 AD) is depicted. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Lenin (el=deity in Hebrew, nine = no in German; so, when chanted repeatedly is blasphemy against the Creator), and Yosef were possessed by Azazel; now, Rico Cortes is possessed by Azazel. WW3 happens; 7% of people will be left; after people are tired of war, they will elect the antichrist as one world leader; donLHM#t vote. ISIS stands for Israeli Secret Intelligence Service. Next false flag: Statue of Liberty in order to attack Iran; one big shake, one giant step forward, one giant collapse. Move away from coasts as nukes will go off in the ocean (at where tectonic plates meet; result: megatsunamis 1km high). Wear natural clothing so that if a bomb goes off it wonLHM#t stick to the body as fast as synthetic clothes. All metal will be burned for fuel; so, save knives, crowbars, shovels, wood-burning stoves, etc. Also, save cloth/fabric/textile to cover the wounds and diseases. Eat natural food because nanochips, cells of aborted fetuses, bug DNA, and other poisons are in food that is commonly sold; reject vaccines, medical care, medicine, etc. because nanochips are administered thru IVs, implants, fillings, etc. If 1000-1500 nanochips are in your right hand, then you canLHM#t make proper Orthodox sign of the cross with the right hand; last mercy for you then will be to cut the hand off. Seraphim of Sarov and Sergiy of Radonezh will be resurrecred after WW3 for a short time; Seraphim of Sarov will show the new Ruski Tsar who will fight the antichrist for about 2 years and 8 months. Those who go see Seraphim of Sarov will be healed of their infirmities/illnesses/sicknesses/ diseases; if you want to see him then, hurry because he wonLHM#t stay longer than a few weeks. Earth is flat; stands on 3 pillars (the Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; donLHM#t believe in horoscopes or youLHM#ll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreams are from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Humans were created about 7525 years ago. Ruski Orthodox Christian Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Enoch and Elijah return to preach against the antichrist. Birds participate in time creation. ItLHM#s a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level. They will get out through sinkholes and lakes. To kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite people to be healed inside their UFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. GovLHM#t provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If youLHM#re being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. DonLHM#t panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)Moon 2)Inside fake mountain Kailash in Tibet 3)In lake Baikal in Russia 4)In Atlantis which is underneath the Mariana Trench in Pacific Ocean. There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. HeLHM#s possessed by Satan since heLHM#s 12 years old. He flies. He wears gloves to hide long nails. HeLHM#s surrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. DonLHM#t go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Green 666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (World Passport). Police will microchip and isotope ray people on the highways. Microchipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, 666 is given. Food stores will isotope ray people too. Antichrist will also release prisoners to mark people. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If youLHM#re about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with Orthodox Christians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichristLHM#s minions canLHM#t track you. Give to charity in the name of Archangel Michael; he rescues people from temporary hell twice a year (or brings them up a level, that is, to a level with less punishment; eventually, people are freed). Feed the pigeons; when pigeons bow down, people are saved from temporary hell.

SATAN DOES indeed have control of this world so there is a need to be careful of how he & his demons affect people: Please note: *** g94 9/22 p. 3 The Rise and Fall of Satanism *** The Rise and Fall of Satanism Satanic rituals performed by black-robed priests in dark cellars, chanting prayers over bound victims on an altar, with flickering candles casting eerie shadows on the walls as the worship of their god, Satan, proceeds. Drawn close by the secret knowledge of some shared mystery with a touch of the supernatural, the young participants on this journey into the occult relish the tingle of excitement that fills the air. They draw close with an uncanny feeling of an exclusiveness that they alone possess. A harmless, passing fad? Or a demonic evil pervading today’s society? REAMS have been written in newspapers, magazines, and books about the lurid deeds of satanic cults. Details of the widespread activity of violent satanic groups have been aired on national television and radio. It has become a major problem for police in both the small and the big cities in America, Canada, and Europe. Satanism has a special lure for today’s youths. The founder of the Church of Satan explains why, as reported in ’Teen magazine of June 1993: “Instead of commanding members to repress their natural urges, we teach that they should follow them. This includes physical lust, the desire for revenge, the drive for material possessions.” How Satan must be pleased with this diabolically inspired ideology, since it goes counter to God-inspired Christian principles! Satanism is on the rise. It is a growing menace, but its demise is imminent. Its god is under sentence of death. So is Satan’s world and its supporters, for “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (1 John 5:19; Romans 6:16) To Satan’s worshipers and to all others who are knowingly or unknowingly serving Satan’s purposes, Jehovah’s message is: “The God who gives peace will crush Satan under your feet shortly.”—Romans 16:20.

20160511212138AAS8kAx	What does Virgin Mary represent?	ILHM#ve always seen paintings and photos of her but I never know what shes supposed to symbolize, stand for, or represent? Is it just the emasculate conception or is there more to it than that?	The cult of The Virgin Mary really took off as the new faith of Christianity spread around the diaspora and out into the gentile world of the Roman Empire during the first and second centuries. The idea of the LHM#virginLHM# birth in the accepted sense can be seen as a response to the number of goddess-sects, often with a strong element of sexual licence, which were prevalent at the time ( a good example being the cults of Artemis at Ephesus and of various Eastern fertility cults assimilated by the Romans. The use of the term LHM#virginLHM# in the special sense of LHM#virgo intactaLHM# really took root at this time as scriptural references used in support of the idea ("Behold a virgin shall conceive etc) are really references merely to LHM#a young womanLHM#. In fact, in a world of sexual promiscuity and outlandish sexual practices, the Virgin Mary became elevated to a level of purity and asexuality which made her a symbol of abstinence and purity which the Early Church felt reflected her role in the point at which divinity and humanity coalesced in Creation in direct contrast to the classical religions in which Gods freely copulated with human females. The later imposition of celibacy on the clergy of the roman Catholic Church probably played its part in the elevation of the LHM#virginLHM# cult to its later state of obsessive purity since celibates may then happily approach the whole matter of sex without any awareness of what a LHM#messyLHM# and unintellectual business it really is, condemning lust and passion, rather than really engaging with the one-to-one conjoining which sexuality demands.	0	· 2 weeks ago	/activity/questions?show=7A5PDDLMHN3VVQQBZUQ3TSSOKY&t=g	Society & Culture Mythology & Folklore	0	0	Comment	2016-05-12T04:21:38Z	/activity/questions?show=S33YQENAQVCYQ6QVOF7BHYSI7E&t=g

Jesus is the great Physician, he is the only mediator between God and man and Him only should be worshipped.

20160513215654AArrE9l	How did the united states and the soviet union used nuclear weapons as a form of deterrence? In the Cold war?	null	The idea of MAD (=Mutually Assured Destruction) meaning that whoever started a nuclear war would be wiped out as surely as the other side, meant. it was assumed, that no sane person would start such a war and that peace would be ensured. (Witness the outcome of the Cuban Missile Crisis). The one flaw in this otherwise comforting argument was the addition of a person who was actually LHM#madLHM# to whom normal reason did not apply. This was proposed in "Dr Strangelove" where the insanity of a commander in the US airforce leads to the dropping of nuclear bombs on Russia in KubrickLHM#s memorable film.	0	· 2 weeks ago	/activity/questions?show=7A5PDDLMHN3VVQQBZUQ3TSSOKY&t=g	Arts & Humanities History	0	0	Comment	2016-05-14T04:56:54Z	/activity/questions?show=KRGSBS2R5KSRQPFKQD3XEZ2E3Y&t=g
20160513215654AArrE9l	How did the united states and the soviet union used nuclear weapons as a form of deterrence? In the Cold war?	null	Same way Russia, China and US do today, through the concept of MAD (mutually ensured destruction). The sheer size, destructive power and more recently highly advanced delivery systems of each sides nuclear arsenal ensure that if one side attacked another the other would immediately retaliate resulting in the complete destruction of both sides and possibly the entire human civilization. Essentially a "if you shoot i shoot" kind of scenario. It was largely this concept that kept the cold war from going hot. Originally the nuclear arms race between the US and the Soviet Union came down to who had sufficiently numerous and sufficiently powerful nuclear weapons to ensure the complete destruction of the other side. The Soviet Union won that race with the Tzar bomb (the most powerful nuclear device in the world to this day). After the collapse of the Soviet Union leading nuclear powers have been working towards gradually reducing their nuclear arsenal.	1	· 2 weeks ago ·	/activity/questions?show=3RG42KPDZOP7XNRDVD6HE6XGKQ&t=g	Arts & Humanities History	0	0	Comment	2016-05-14T04:56:54Z	/activity/questions?show=KRGSBS2R5KSRQPFKQD3XEZ2E3Y&t=g
20160513215654AArrE9l	How did the united states and the soviet union used nuclear weapons as a form of deterrence? In the Cold war?	null	Nuclear Weapons are regarded for their massive destructive potential which is the main reason why the US and USSR built so many. However the reasoning behind this at least publicly was called "deterrence", or deterring the enemy from making a strike before a strike was even made. Basically stopping an attack through fear before it even happens, the existence of hundreds of nuclear weapons owned by both states prevented either side from using them. This stalemate was known as a state of MAD or mutually assured destruction where if either state were to fire their nukes the other would too and both would be destroyed simultaneously. This basically prevented either state from firing the weapons and deterring each other from doing so.	2	· 2 weeks ago ·	/activity/questions?show=2YKYAWDWGTDPGGXGSW6OA5MN3I&t=g	Arts & Humanities History	1	0	Comment	2016-05-14T04:56:54Z	/activity/questions?show=KRGSBS2R5KSRQPFKQD3XEZ2E3Y&t=g

20160512161644AANUBtp	In Romeo and Juliet, why does Shakespeare use the word LHM#baptisLHM#dLHM# instead of LHM#baptizedLHM#?	null	All of ShakespeareLHM#s plays are written in iambic pentameters, or verse in other words. Sometimes, to fit in with the metre words need to be said in a LHM#contractedLHM# way. Hence the apostrophe indicating a missing letter or syllable. The correct spelling (with an LHM#sLHM#) as opposed to LHM#zLHM# means that the sibilant is pronounced LHM#unvoicedLHM# as opposed to LHM#voicedLHM#. Try reading Shakespeare to the rhythm of a heartbeat. Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum. Just gently. Almost in the background.

20160422014449AAeGiYv	If people truly followed The Ten Commandments, from the beginning, what would the world be like today?	Please use your imagination people, if not, then donLHM#t answer the question.	Most people naturally follow the spirit of the Decalogue. It is essentially a reformulation of rules for conduct of which there were many similar sets in ancient cultures. You may be adhering to a the sort of mindset which Jesus himself criticised, for over emphasis on your own interpretation. The Shabat, for instance, was seen as a gift, A day off each week. Keeping it LHM#holyLHM# essentially meant keeping it apart from other days. The idea that it was a penance rather than a pleasure is an incorrect derivation from the letter of the Torah rather than its true meaning, Killing too refers, in the context of the Commandments, to a specific range of activities and clearly does not form a blanket prohibition since having come down from the mountain Moses causes those who rebelled against his instructions to be killed! So to LHM#truly followLHM# as you put it, people first have to interpret and understand. That is something which I would suggest, history shows us is unlikely to happen.	0	· 1 month ago	/activity/questions?show=7A5PDDLMHN3VVQQBZUQ3TSSOKY&t=g	Society & Culture Religion & Spirituality	0	0	Comment	2016-04-22T08:44:49Z	/activity/questions?show=RQU5F4MEWOWMT2WTKSXBXAJVDQ&t=g

20160429085555AAmuNlj	Is it more likely that Jesus or King Arthur existed?	null	Jesus. There never was a LHM#King ArthurLHM#. The origin of the legend may have been to do with the leader of a Romano-British band of soldiers, defending their lands against the incoming Saxons (if indeed there ever was an LHM#invasionLHM# in the sense that Bede wrote about it). Arthur is very much a folkloric figure. The stories were greatly embellished over time by a number of writers including Layamon in his LHM#BrutLHM# and of course Sir Thomas Mallory. No connection has ever been established between Arthur and Tintagel in Cornwall, or with Maiden Castle and LHM#CamelotLHM#. By contrast there is a great deal of, albeit sometimes circumstantial, evidence for the existence of Jesus. Rather like looking for sub-atomic particles, the evidence is from their effect (yet I am sure you accept the existence of electrons, photons, and quarks, which can only be detected by their effects. Yes Jesus was living in a time of new ideas, many not greatly different from his own, yet he made a radical change in the way that we look at ourselves.	0	· 4 weeks ago	/activity/questions?show=7A5PDDLMHN3VVQQBZUQ3TSSOKY&t=g	Society & Culture Religion & Spirituality	0	3	1 comment	2016-04-29T15:55:55Z	/activity/questions?show=TMNIMZCEMT4A2XULOVXQMZ7HYY&t=g

20160322085500AAo2qEj	Why did the Roman Empire fall?	null	A combination of factors although Gibbon put it down to the coming of Christianity. In fact, despite its amazing size and military prowess, Rome was like all other empires which seem to reach a point where internal stresses, inevitable from its growth, bring about its demise. In the case of the Romans the lack of a civil service and reliance upon ad hoc appointments of governors in various regions may have been coupled with something as basic as progressive lead poisoning caused by cooking in large lead pots for the ruling elite. (Not recommended if you value cerebral function!) In fact all empires eventually reach a point of a sort of territorial LHM#diminishing returnsLHM# simply because extensions of boundaries of the Empire requires ever greater deployment of troops. In the case of Rome, the failure to establish an effective way to elect a successor to an emperor certainly played a part as from Augustus on, a succession of individual who had suffered the most dysfunctional childhoods (Nero, Caligula) were doomed to fail. Attempts to reform the constitution and society (led by such as the Graachi) were really subsidiary to the unfortunate fact of the chap at the top.	0	· 2 months ago	/activity/questions?show=7A5PDDLMHN3VVQQBZUQ3TSSOKY&t=g	Arts & Humanities History	0	0	Comment	2016-03-22T15:55:00Z	/activity/questions?show=7T2S42ETEXF4TGIZWLI5B4R6SI&t=g

20160127211123AAez7UI	What does Lent celebrate and what does it have to do with Mardi Gras season? Also, why is there a baby Jesus inside of most king cakes?	null	In mediaeval Europe, and indeed more recently in some parts of the World, the period after the Winter Solstice marked the time of seriously depleted foodstocks since most animals has already been slaughtered because of lack of fodder and most salted meat and preserved (i.e salted and pickled) vegetables were running low. By the beginning of forty days before Easter things were becoming serious. People were having to eat grass and the number of "demoniac possessions" resulting from eating grain tainted with the psychogenic ergot fungus were increasing! The Church thus made a virtue of a necessity by imposing LHM#fastingLHM# as model behaviour during the period leading to the festival which celebrates the Crucifixion and Resurrection (appropriate for a time of burgeoning springtime activity in the natural world and new plant growth which marked the coming of new food). Mardi Gras is the vulgar side of preparations for the start of the Lenten fast (by consuming anything left over which would not survive the forty days). LHM#Shrove TuesdayLHM# with the idea of LHM#shrivingLHM# in preparation for the days of prayer and fasting is the more spiritual name. As to LHM#baby Jesus in cakesLHM# I havenLHM#t a clue what you are talking about.

20160127211123AAez7UI	What does Lent celebrate and what does it have to do with Mardi Gras season? Also, why is there a baby Jesus inside of most king cakes?	null	The Catholic Church and many other Christian Churches follow the Biblical practice of Jesus Christ and the Jews in setting aside days where the entire Church fasts and prays as one in a attitude of constant renewal. By the solemn forty days of Lent the Church unites herself each year to the mystery of Jesus in the desert and in spiritual preparation for the celebration of His Passion, Death, and Resurrection. This season of penance is an intense moment of the ChurchLHM#s penitential practice and are particularly appropriate for spiritual exercises, penitential liturgies, pilgrimages as signs of penance, voluntary self-denial such as fasting and alms-giving, and charitable and missionary works. The Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches also observe the season of Lent. Many modern Protestant Churches consider the observation of Lent to be a choice, rather than an obligation. Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday) is the day before the first day of Lent on Ash Wednesday. For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 1438.

20160127211123AAez7UI	What does Lent celebrate and what does it have to do with Mardi Gras season? Also, why is there a baby Jesus inside of most king cakes?	null	Lent is a manufactured "observance" and, regardless of how many reasons are given to support it, I feel it is wrong because it is not instituted by God. And one of the MAIN reasons I oppose Lent IS the creation of mardi gras. It was created as a sort of "last fling" before the strictures of Lent. One last chance to do all sorts of bad, ungodly things before Lent "clamps down" on believers and limits them in all sorts of ways. Therefore, Lent encourages all sorts of bad behavior in the form of mardi gras, As per the article below: Traditionally, a small plastic or porcelain baby is hidden into the king cake. It is usually green, gold, or purple to represent the colors of the holiday. Originally, the baby was placed into the cake to symbolize baby Jesus. Fava beans were also used to represent Jesus. Today, the baby symbolizes luck and prosperity to whoever finds it in his/her slice of cake. In some traditions, the finder of the baby is designated “king” or “queen” for the evening. That person is also responsible for purchasing next year’s cake, or for throwing the next Mardi Gras party. There you have it. Through him we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in our hope of sharing the glory of God. (Romans 5:2) MARANATHA!

Also, why is there a baby Jesus inside of most king cakes?	null	What does Lent celebrate and what does it have to do with Mardi Gras season? Also, why is there a baby Jesus inside of most king cakes? Fake Patriarch Kirill and other fake church leaders signed a document in 2006 where it says that all religions worship the same supreme being; anathema. Last Orthodox Patriarch is Patriarch Irenaios of Jerusalem. Major heresy of the last century was that the name of the Creator doesnLHM#t have anything to do with the Creator. American pronunciation of the word "God/god" is "gaad" which means Satan in Ruski. Ruski words for "English" and "angelic" are very similar; Satan was an angel. Read only Bible that is translated by theologians. John the Baptist ate only carobs and honey. Eating bugs like locusts leads to demon possession and three stands of DNA. 666ed people eat GMO food (which is food with bug DNA). Ecumenism has 263 heresies; each heresy leads to hell. Roman Catholic icons are drawn from naked people. Orthodox icons are inspired by the Holy Spirit. When you look directly into the eyes of the figure depicted on an Orthodox icon, energy is coming your way, that is, you get healed. If you look at Buddhist-Roman Catholic-Satanic icons, you get the passions from the person depicted. There has been a study done by Ruski scientists. When an Orthodox Christian crosses regular water, it becomes better. When an Orthodox Christian priest crosses regular water, it becomes even better than if regular Orthodox Christian crosses the water. This is the usual. Now, we are in the end days. In some churches (that have been infiltrated by the antichristLHM#s minions), antichristLHM#s blood is served. Also, scanners put 666 on foreheads at the entrance. Theotokos Virgin Mary pushed down the altars at these churches (invisible to humans). Icons in these churches are changed to Satanic-Buddhist-Roman Catholic type instead of normal. Water (instead of becoming better) becomes worse when "blessed" in these "churches". Orthodox icons must have correct hand signals. Correct blessing hand means Alpha and Omega AND Iesus Christous (Jesus Christ in Greek and Church Slavonic). Incorrect hand signals are signifying the antichrist. Also, do you see the scrolls on the Orthodox icons? They will be opened when antichrist will be coming to town. These scrolls will reveal everything about the antichrist. Note also, calendar must be Orthodox, not Roman Catholic. During the 8th "wolf" Council, antichrist will kill those priests who disagree with him. Other priests will worship him when a bird dies at his feet. Pelageya of Ryazan said that there will only be seven churches left in the end days. Vaccines, IVs, tooth fillings/implants, cosmetics, medicaments, certain foods and drinks, etc. contain nanochips and/or cells of aborted fetuses; intake of which leads to demon possession. Give back your documents to the govLHM#t and live in Ural Mountains or Alaska. Heresy leads to loss of love. Rapture is a heresy. You have to hide with Orthodox Christians to escape 666. Reject globalism, UFOs, documents, vaccines, ecumenism, cities, technology, etc. The only true Christians are people who rejected mark of the beast documents and drink blood of Jesus. Note, some churches serve antichristLHM#s blood. So, choose wisely. Read the Book of Revelation. ItLHM#s all clear now anyway if you have wisdom to understand that 2 elongated lines on a barcode is a 6. Each barcode has 3 double elongated lines. Hence, it spells 666. Barcode on documents leads to temporary hell. Barcode on oneLHM#s body by isotope rays leads to permanent hell. According to Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov, 666ed people will first hide the green 666 with durags and long sleeves, but then openly will walk with shiny green 666 on their foreheads or wrists. The Most Holy Trinity gives you a name during baptism. Devil gives you an anti-name during anti-baptism. Barcode is Druid black magic curse and a form of mark of the beast just like Social Security. People who took any number (which is an anti-name given during anti-baptism by the beast) on documents or in computer go to temporary hell; but those who receive green 666 (given with World Passport with no name on it) on forehead or wrist go to permanent hell. How not to go to hell? Give back all these anti-name anti-baptism documents back to the beast by writing to appropriate authorities. If authorities refuse to cancel these anti-names, then write again (up to three times). If you wrote to the govLHM#t three times about it, but govLHM#t refused, then The Most Holy Trinity will not send you to hell. DonLHM#t take the microchip. If you already took it, get rid of it because microchipped people will be influenced by computers to take the World Passport (grey plastic card with no name on it). DonLHM#t go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Those who reject 666 will go to heaven. Also, their direct ancestors will be saved from hell. All who call on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or sign themselves with sign of the cross during WW3 will be saved. War in Ukraine will last two years (2014 - 2016). Then WW3 will start. Then Tsar (revealed by resurrected Seraphim of Sarov) will come to power in Russia to protect people from the antichrist. Antichrist will allow all sin. DonLHM#t sin. The Most Holy Trinity is merciful but 666 is not forgivable. 666 is given with grey plastic card. Food stores, prisoners, and police will 666 people too. DonLHM#t get new documents. DonLHM#t get any surgeries. DonLHM#t eat meat. DonLHM#t eat fast food. DonLHM#t eat junk food. Pray the Jesus prayer. DonLHM#t go into UFO to be healed by evil demons. Feed the pigeons. Give to charity in the name of Archangel Michael. Reject vaccines. Hide with Orthodox Christians to escape mark of the beast; leave all electronics behind so that you canLHM#t be tracked. AntichristLHM#s next target is the Statue of Liberty. One big shake, one giant step forward, one giant collapse. You use your spirit to talk to The Most Holy Trinity. Demons attack soul and body. Demons live inside clones. Jesus died for all sins committed by all. Jesus said that you have to drink His blood. All people have soul, body, and spirit. In animals, blood substitutes soul. ThatLHM#s why youLHM#re forbidden to drink animal blood. Animals donLHM#t have spirit. YouLHM#re forbidden to drink human blood (like during blood transfusion) because sins transfer. YouLHM#re told to drink blood of Jesus (because HeLHM#s sinless) so that your sins are forgiven. Dogs are not allowed in your home and your church because the Holy Spirit will leave. One can receive mark of the beast because of cats; so, stay away from cats. Give to charity in the name of Archangel Michael; he rescues people from hell twice a year (or brings them up a level, that is, to a level with less punishment; eventually, people are freed). Feed the pigeons; when pigeons bow down, people are saved from hell. Birds participate in time creation. ItLHM#s a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level. They will get out through sinkholes and lakes. To kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Since antichrist (born to a 12th generation prostitute, flying, big-nailed, gloved, pale-faced, red-eyed, Satan-possessed since heLHM#s 12 years old, homosexual man from the tribe of Dan, who wears blue robe over left shoulder while red/pink robe is underneath just like Jesus, and is surrounded by demons but people see angels of light) is around, there is no need for disputes.

Meaning of this quote? Three big earthquakes will shake the three superpowers; 1st big earthquake in Russia; 2nd (bigger one) in China; 3rd (biggest of the three) will be in America. NATO will nuke Ukraine to blame Russia for it; then NATO will nuke Russia from Scandinavia. China will attack Russia; but will not get past Ural Mountains; bio-genetic weapon will be used against Chinese soldiers (they will run back to China and hide in closets in fear) and weather weapon will freeze Siberia to - 200 Celcius; stadium-size chunks of unmeltable ice will fall from the lower sky (because when rockets go into higher sky they bring this ice down to lower sky). Russia will destroy Turkey and America. China will have a hole across the whole country to the abyss (because of another super weapon used to stop Chinese aggression); radiation from this hole will be massive; Chinese will try to keep quiet about it; a lot of people will fall into this hole. Scientists donLHM#t see dinosaurs because of radiation. Only Eurasia and Alaska (both without coasts) will remain after demons blow up Antarctica (which surrounds the flat earth) and Greenland melts. Move to Ural Mountains or inland Alaska. Sionists want war between Russia and Germany over Serbia from June to October on their holidays because (666 times 3)+(6 times 3) = 2016 (in their twisted logic). Tube people = demons. Clones = demons. Human costumes that demons wear = demons. Dinosaurs and 666ed people have triple stranded DNA; normal person canLHM#t swallow 666ed food (designed for 666ed people). Demons live inside clones. Bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin (who discovered Bubonic plague) is depicted on the Shroud of Turin. There is another shroud on which blasphemer Yosef (who was crucified on a pole in 1066 AD) is depicted. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Lenin (el=deity in Hebrew, nine = no in German; so, when chanted repeatedly is blasphemy against the Creator), and Yosef were possessed by Azazel; now, Rico Cortes is possessed by Azazel. WW3 happens; 7% of people will be left; after people are tired of war, they will elect the antichrist as one world leader; donLHM#t vote. ISIS stands for Israeli Secret Intelligence Service. Next false flag: Statue of Liberty in order to attack Iran; one big shake, one giant step forward, one giant collapse. Move away from coasts as nukes will go off in the ocean (at where tectonic plates meet; result: megatsunamis 1km high). Wear natural clothing so that if a bomb goes off it wonLHM#t stick to the body as fast as synthetic clothes. All metal will be burned for fuel; so, save knives, crowbars, shovels, wood-burning stoves, etc. Also, save cloth/fabric/textile to cover the wounds and diseases. Eat natural food because nanochips, cells of aborted fetuses, bug DNA, and other poisons are in food that is commonly sold; reject vaccines, medical care, medicine, etc. because nanochips are administered thru IVs, implants, fillings, etc. If 1000-1500 nanochips are in your right hand, then you canLHM#t make proper Orthodox sign of the cross with the right hand; last mercy for you then will be to cut the hand off. Seraphim of Sarov and Sergiy of Radonezh will be resurrecred after WW3 for a short time; Seraphim of Sarov will show the new Ruski Tsar who will fight the antichrist for about 2 years and 8 months. Those who go see Seraphim of Sarov will be healed of their infirmities/illnesses/sicknesses/ diseases; if you want to see him then, hurry because he wonLHM#t stay longer than a few weeks. Earth is flat; stands on 3 pillars (the Most Holy Trinity); pillars stand on water at zero Kelvin. Zodiac is planetary prison of demons; donLHM#t believe in horoscopes or youLHM#ll exhibit the traits of the trapped demons. Most thoughts and dreams are from demons; demons never do good. Sleep fully clothed; pray the Jesus prayer. Pray to your guardian angel to have normal sleep. Humans were created about 7525 years ago. Ruski Orthodox Christian Vyacheslav Krasheninnikov was the last prophet before Enoch and Elijah return to preach against the antichrist. Birds participate in time creation. ItLHM#s a sin to kill birds. Dinosaurs live under our level. They will get out through sinkholes and lakes. To kill them, go for their nerves. Save the birds; but kill the dinosaurs. First dinosaur will come out of Volga River in Russia. Demons grow human skin (from a sample taken during abduction) and put it on so as to look like us. Demons will invite people to be healed inside their UFOs; those who go will be like zombies after. GovLHM#t provides demons with diamonds and allows demons to abduct people. If youLHM#re being abducted, slowly pray the Jesus prayer. DonLHM#t panic. Demons use diamonds and souls to power their UFO craft. The bigger the diamond, the more it lasts. Demons have 4 UFO bases: 1)Moon 2)Inside fake mountain Kailash in Tibet 3)In lake Baikal in Russia 4)In Atlantis which is underneath the Mariana Trench in Pacific Ocean. There are no aliens. Nobody lives on other planets. Airplanes that go down are hit by demons because they need the airspace to fight Jesus. Antichrist is pale with red eyes. HeLHM#s possessed by Satan since heLHM#s 12 years old. He flies. He wears gloves to hide long nails. HeLHM#s surrounded by demons who appear as angels of light. DonLHM#t go into a UFO to be healed by demons. Green 666 is given by isotope rays on wrist or forehead when people stretch hands to receive small plastic grey card with no name on it (World Passport). Police will microchip and isotope ray people on the highways. Microchipped people will be influenced by computers to take grey plastic card; but when they do, 666 is given. Food stores will isotope ray people too. Antichrist will also release prisoners to mark people. Reject 666 at all cost because it leads to permanent hell. If youLHM#re about to be marked, pray the Jesus prayer. Hide with Orthodox Christians to escape 666; leave all electronics behind so that antichristLHM#s minions canLHM#t track you. Give to charity in the name of Archangel Michael; he rescues people from temporary hell twice a year (or brings them up a level, that is, to a level with less punishment; eventually, people are freed). Feed the pigeons; when pigeons bow down, people are saved from temporary hell.

Germany controls Europe anyway.	It was the second immense war in less than a generation and the Americans made disbanding the Empire a condition of aid. (Agreed between Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill). Britain had to take part to defend itself and its Empire from the Nazis. And yes, the generous aid of our American allies had to be paid for.

Britain took part in the Second World War as a result of German aggression.

20160524063853AA1VoIL	ILHM#d like to make a little return on an investment and withdraw most in 1 year, so what type of investment should I do?	I plan on investing around $1,000 and withdrawing most of it in 1 year...what should I do with it? Stocks, bonds, CD, Money Market..? Would appreciate suggestions and advice, thanks!	That depends on your goal. A year is a very short time for stocks. On average, the stock market has gone up about 10% per year, but within that average are a lot of ups and downs. Would you prefer an investment that has a 50% chance of gaining 20% and a 50% chance of losing 10% ? Choose stocks. Would prefer an investment that will have a 2% gain with zero risk? Choose a CD or money market account.	0	· 3 days ago	/activity/questions?show=4EBJYADXY3FI4DBMCSZ7CEIUTY&t=g	Business & Finance Investing	1	0	Comment	2016-05-24T13:38:53Z	null

Closing an investment in just 1 year is considered short-term. Normally, you donLHM#t expose short-term money to stock market risk because you never know when the bottom will fall out. Therefore, open a savings account with Ally Bank and draw 1 percent.	1	· 2 days ago ·	/activity/questions?show=EBQBIMKLKP66X5WYXN56YL3JWE&t=g	Business & Finance Investing	0	0	Comment	2016-05-24T13:38:53Z	null

Nothing that involves any transaction fees - that would basically eat up whatever gain youLHM#d make in a year, which is not going to be a lot.

CDLHM#s and money markets will make you at most $25 over that year so it is hardy worth it. Stocks/bonds are the only way you COULD make more than 5% BUT you could lose easily at least 5%. so pick your poison	3	· 3 days ago ·	/activity/questions?show=A2DAAHVOPHLKUFUHCXNBLBTROY&t=g	Business & Finance Investing	0	0	Comment	2016-05-24T13:38:53Z	null

One year is a very short time horizon. Just put it in a CD - and expect very little return.	4	· 3 days ago ·	/activity/questions?show=QRAUJRIPQOHKXANVCDN6O7EMMU&t=g	Business & Finance Investing	2	0	Comment	2016-05-24T13:38:53Z	null

20160518195932AAomx1d	Why would procrastination about going to see the doctor lead to having a severe kidney infection instead of a simpler bladder infection?	null	The kidney is connected to the bladder. Infection in the bladder can spread to a kidney. The longer a bladder infection goes untreated, the more likely it is to spread. Any kidney infection is severe due to the structure and function of the kidneys.	0	· 1 week ago	/activity/questions?show=4EBJYADXY3FI4DBMCSZ7CEIUTY&t=g	Health Diseases & Conditions Other - Diseases	1	0	Comment	2016-05-19T02:59:32Z	null

Feels like pressure in my head and it slowly fades to black, lasts a few seconds and im extremely off balance and have to hold on to something not to fall. Then it all goes away . Does this happen to you ?	ThatLHM#s called postural hypotension. It is not a sign of any disease. ItLHM#s more likely to happen when you are dehydrated or your blood sugar is low, so make sure youLHM#re eating and drinking enough. If it still happens, there is nothing that needs to be done. If you are passing out often, your doctor can prescribe medications that will reduce the occurrences, but there is no need for medical attention.	0	· 1 day ago	/activity/questions?show=4EBJYADXY3FI4DBMCSZ7CEIUTY&t=g	Health General Health Care Other - General Health Care	0	0	Comment	2016-05-25T22:55:22Z	/activity/questions?show=UMV464HE7KUFCRHA4ZDNDA3KNM&t=g

Does this happen to you ?	ItLHM#s because youLHM#re standing up too quickly, Basically what is happening is that when you change position kind of fast, the blood canLHM#t reach your eyes in time so you canLHM#t see for a few seconds. This implies that you could have slightly low blood pressure. Try changing your position slower and also eating saltier foods helps raise blood pressure.	1	· 1 day ago ·	/activity/questions?show=RJ4AVK3S2KZOTHGRKBSVICM6GY&t=g	Health General Health Care Other - General Health Care	0	0	Comment	2016-05-25T22:55:22Z	/activity/questions?show=UMV464HE7KUFCRHA4ZDNDA3KNM&t=g

20160229181025AAYvVeb	What would happen if I went to a psychologist?	When you go to a psychologist, do they screen you for other disorders besides the one you think you have? Because I am paranoid that ILHM#m crazy...	If they think you have other disorders, they will ask your regular physician or a psychiatrist to diagnose you. YouLHM#re not crazy. You have an anxiety disorder, and your anxiety is stopping you from getting help for your anxiety. See a psychologist. It will help.	0	· 3 months ago	/activity/questions?show=4EBJYADXY3FI4DBMCSZ7CEIUTY&t=g	Health Mental Health	0	0	Comment	2016-03-01T02:10:25Z	/activity/questions?show=F66IESVH3UFROKYYGH6QDP3JUQ&t=g
